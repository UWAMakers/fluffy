Okay, well maybe they're only a little bit mistaken. Fluffy, who was purchased from "*a Greek chappie*", may be recognised by those who remember their mythology well as none other than Cerberus â€“ gatekeeper of the underworld.

This repository hosts the source code and schematics for the RFID locks for the equipment in our lab. Because some of our equipment may cause injuries or death if used by untrained operators, you might say that these locks prevent you from ending up in.. ah you all get it.

> tl;dr: we made a guard dog / gatekeeper for our machines. Moving on.

## Prior Art

*Team Fluffy* is quite proud of our effort to keep members safe in our labs. We can't take all of the credit though, as this project is based on an existing commercial product called [Access Pack](http://www.soledigital.com.au/accesspack.html), which is manufactured and sold by Sole Digital. In fact, thanks to the kind support from Sole Digital, we also use the same enclosures for the "puck" that mounts to the exterior of a given machine.
